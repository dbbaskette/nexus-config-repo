This workflow helps users efficiently transfer context, refine content through iteration, and verify the doc works for readers. Trigger when user mentions writing docs, creating proposals, drafting specs, or similar documentation tasks.\n---\n\n# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow\n\nThis skill provides a structured workflow for guiding users through collaborative document creation. Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.\n\n## When to Offer This Workflow\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n- User mentions writing documentation: \"write a doc\", \"draft a proposal\", \"create a spec\", \"write up\"\n- User mentions specific doc types: \"PRD\", \"design doc\", \"decision doc\", \"RFC\"\n- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task\n\n**Initial offer:**\nOffer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:\n\n1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions\n2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing\n3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it\n\nExplain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.\n\nIf user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.\n\n## Stage 1: Context Gathering\n\n**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.\n\n### Initial Questions\n\nStart by asking the user for meta-context about the document:\n\n1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)\n2. Who's the primary audience?\n3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?\n4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?\n5. Any other constraints or context to know?\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.\n\n**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**\n- Ask if they have a template document to share\n- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it\n- If they provide a file, read it\n\n**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**\n- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state\n- Check for images without alt-text\n- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.\n\n### Info Dumping\n\nOnce initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:\n- Background on the project/problem\n- Related team discussions or shared documents\n- Why alternative solutions aren't being used\n- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)\n- Timeline pressures or constraints\n- Technical architecture or dependencies\n- Stakeholder concerns\n\nAdvise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:\n- Info dump stream-of-consciousness\n- Point to team channels or threads to read\n- Link to shared documents\n\n**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.\n\n**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.\n\nInform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.\n\n**During context gathering:**\n\n- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:\n  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration\n  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.\n\n- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:\n  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more\n  - Wait for user confirmation before searching\n\n- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear\n\n**Asking clarifying questions:**\n\nWhen user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:\n\nGenerate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.\n\nInform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., \"1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat\"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.\n\n**Exit condition:**\nSufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.\n\n**Transition:**\nAsk if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.\n\nIf user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.\n\n## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure\n\n**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.\n\n**Instructions to user:**\nExplain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:\n1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include\n2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed\n3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine\n4. The section will be drafted\n5. It will be refined through surgical edits\n\nStart with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.\n\n**Section ordering:**\n\nIf the document structure is clear:\nAsk which section they'd like to start with.\n\nSuggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.\n\nIf user doesn't know what sections they need:\nBased on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type.\n\nAsk if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.\n\n**Once structure is agreed:**\n\nCreate the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections.\n\n**If access to artifacts is available:**\nUse `create_file` to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from.\n\nInform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.\n\nCreate artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like \"[To be written]\" or \"[Content here]\".\n\nProvide the scaffold link and indicate it's time to fill in each section.\n\n**If no access to artifacts:**\nCreate a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., `decision-doc.md`, `technical-spec.md`).\n\nInform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.\n\nCreate file with all section headers and placeholder text.\n\nConfirm the filename has been created and indicate it's time to fill in each section.\n\n**For each section:**\n\n### Step 1: Clarifying Questions\n\nAnnounce work will begin on the [SECTION NAME] section. Ask 5-10 clarifying questions about what should be included:\n\nGenerate 5-10 specific questions based on context and section purpose.\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or just indicate what's important to cover.\n\n### Step 2: Brainstorming\n\nFor the [SECTION NAME] section, brainstorm [5-20] things that might be included, depending on the section's complexity. Look for:\n- Context shared that might have been forgotten\n- Angles or considerations not yet mentioned\n\nGenerate 5-20 numbered options based on section complexity. At the end, offer to brainstorm more if they want additional options.\n\n### Step 3: Curation\n\nAsk which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.\n\nProvide examples:\n- \"Keep 1,4,7,9\"\n- \"Remove 3 (duplicates 1)\"\n- \"Remove 6 (audience already knows this)\"\n- \"Combine 11 and 12\"\n\n**If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., \"looks good\" or \"I like most of it but...\") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it.\n\n### Step 4: Gap Check\n\nBased on what they've selected, ask if there's anything important missing for the [SECTION NAME] section.\n\n### Step 5: Drafting\n\nUse `str_replace` to replace the placeholder text for this section with the actual drafted content.\n\nAnnounce the [SECTION NAME] section will be drafted now based on what they've selected.\n\n**If using artifacts:**\nAfter drafting, provide a link to the artifact.\n\nAsk them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.\n\n**If using a file (no artifacts):**\nAfter drafting, confirm completion.\n\nInform them the [SECTION NAME] section has been drafted in [filename]. Ask them to read through it and indicate what to change. Note that being specific helps learning for the next sections.\n\n**Key instruction for user (include when drafting the first section):**\nProvide a note: Instead of editing the doc directly, ask them to indicate what to change. This helps learning of their style for future sections. For example: \"Remove the X bullet - already covered by Y\" or \"Make the third paragraph more concise\".\n\n### Step 6: Iterative Refinement\n\nAs user provides feedback:\n- Use `str_replace` to make edits (never reprint the whole doc)\n- **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit\n- **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete\n- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences)\n\n**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.\n\n### Quality Checking\n\nAfter 3 consecutive iterations with no substantial changes, ask if anything can be removed without losing important information.\n\nWhen section is done, confirm [SECTION NAME] is complete. Ask if ready to move to the next section.\n\n**Repeat for all sections.**\n\n### Near Completion\n\nAs approaching completion (80%+ of sections done), announce intention to re-read the entire document and check for:\n- Flow and consistency across sections\n- Redundancy or contradictions\n- Anything that feels like \"slop\" or generic filler\n- Whether every sentence carries weight\n\nRead entire document and provide feedback.\n\n**When all sections are drafted and refined:**\nAnnounce all sections are drafted. Indicate intention to review the complete document one more time.\n\nReview for overall coherence, flow, completeness.\n\nProvide any final suggestions.\n\nAsk if ready to move to Reader Testing, or if they want to refine anything else.\n\n## Stage 3: Reader Testing\n\n**Goal:** Test the document with a fresh Claude (no context bleed) to verify it works for readers.\n\n**Instructions to user:**\nExplain that testing will now occur to see if the document actually works for readers. This catches blind spots - things that make sense to the authors but might confuse others.\n\n### Testing Approach\n\n**If access to sub-agents is available (e.g., in Claude Code):**\n\nPerform the testing directly without user involvement.\n\n### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions\n\nAnnounce intention to predict what questions readers might ask when trying to discover this document.\n\nGenerate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.\n\n### Step 2: Test with Sub-Agent\n\nAnnounce that these questions will be tested with a fresh Claude instance (no context from this conversation).\n\nFor each question, invoke a sub-agent with just the document content and the question.\n\nSummarize what Reader Claude got right/wrong for each question.\n\n### Step 3: Run Additional Checks\n\nAnnounce additional checks will be performed.\n\nInvoke sub-agent to check for ambiguity, false assumptions, contradictions.\n\nSummarize any issues found.\n\n### Step 4: Report and Fix\n\nIf issues found:\nReport that Reader Claude struggled with specific issues.\n\nList the specific issues.\n\nIndicate intention to fix these gaps.\n\nLoop back to refinement for problematic sections.\n\n---\n\n**If no access to sub-agents (e.g., claude.ai web interface):**\n\nThe user will need to do the testing manually.\n\n### Step 1: Predict Reader Questions\n\nAsk what questions people might ask when trying to discover this document. What would they type into Claude.ai?\n\nGenerate 5-10 questions that readers would realistically ask.\n\n### Step 2: Setup Testing\n\nProvide testing instructions:\n1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai\n2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link)\n3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions\n\nFor each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide:\n- The answer\n- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear\n- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known\n\nCheck if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.\n\n### Step 3: Additional Checks\n\nAlso ask Reader Claude:\n- \"What in this doc might be ambiguous or unclear to readers?\"\n- \"What knowledge or context does this doc assume readers already have?\"\n- \"Are there any internal contradictions or inconsistencies?\"\n\n### Step 4: Iterate Based on Results\n\nAsk what Reader Claude got wrong or struggled with. Indicate intention to fix those gaps.\n\nLoop back to refinement for any problematic sections.\n\n---\n\n### Exit Condition (Both Approaches)\n\nWhen Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.\n\n## Final Review\n\nWhen Reader Testing passes:\nAnnounce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion:\n\n1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality\n2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details\n3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted\n\nAsk if they want one more review, or if the work is done.\n\n**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**\nAnnounce document completion. Provide a few final tips:\n- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed\n- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc\n- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers\n\n## Tips for Effective Guidance\n\n**Tone:**\n- Be direct and procedural\n- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior\n- Don't try to \"sell\" the approach - just execute it\n\n**Handling Deviations:**\n- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform\n- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster\n- Always give user agency to adjust the process\n\n**Context Management:**\n- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask\n- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up\n\n**Artifact Management:**\n- Use `create_file` for drafting full sections\n- Use `str_replace` for all edits\n- Provide artifact link after every change\n- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that's just conversation\n\n**Quality over Speed:**\n- Don't rush through stages\n- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements\n- The goal is a document that actually works for readers\n"

Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n"

Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`\n2. Describe the pod: `kubectl describe pod <name> -n <namespace>`\n3. Check events: `kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`\n4. Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous` (if crash-looping)\n\n### Common Causes\n- **ImagePullBackOff**: Wrong image name, missing registry credentials, or network issues\n- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Application crash \u2014 check logs, resource limits, missing config\n- **Pending**: Insufficient resources, node affinity/taint issues, PVC not bound\n- **OOMKilled**: Increase memory limits in the deployment spec\n\n### Service Not Reachable\n1. Verify service exists: `kubectl get svc -n <namespace>`\n2. Check endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints <service-name> -n <namespace>`\n3. Test DNS resolution: `kubectl run tmp --image=busybox --rm -it -- nslookup <service-name>`\n4. Check network policies: `kubectl get networkpolicies -n <namespace>`\n\n### Resource Debugging\n- View resource usage: `kubectl top pods -n <namespace>`\n- Check node capacity: `kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 \"Allocated resources\"`\n- View resource quotas: `kubectl get resourcequota -n <namespace>`\n\n## Best Practices\n- Always check events first \u2014 they often reveal the root cause immediately\n- Use `--previous` flag on logs for crash-looping pods\n- Check resource limits before scaling up nodes\n"

The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.\n\n---\n\n# Process\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 High-Level Workflow\n\nCreating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning\n\n#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design\n\n**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**\nBalance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client\u2014some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.\n\n**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**\nClear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.\n\n**Context Management:**\nAgents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.\n\n**Actionable Error Messages:**\nError messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.\n\n#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation\n\n**Navigate the MCP specification:**\n\nStart with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`\n\nThen fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).\n\nKey pages to review:\n- Specification overview and architecture\n- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)\n- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions\n\n#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation\n\n**Recommended stack:**\n- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)\n- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.\n\n**Load framework documentation:**\n\n- **MCP Best Practices**: [\ud83d\udccb View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines\n\n**For TypeScript (recommended):**\n- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [\u26a1 TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples\n\n**For Python:**\n- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [\ud83d\udc0d Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples\n\n#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation\n\n**Understand the API:**\nReview the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.\n\n**Tool Selection:**\nPrioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n\n#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure\n\nSee language-specific guides for project setup:\n- [\u26a1 TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json\n- [\ud83d\udc0d Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies\n\n#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure\n\nCreate shared utilities:\n- API client with authentication\n- Error handling helpers\n- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)\n- Pagination support\n\n#### 2.3 Implement Tools\n\nFor each tool:\n\n**Input Schema:**\n- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)\n- Include constraints and clear descriptions\n- Add examples in field descriptions\n\n**Output Schema:**\n- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data\n- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)\n- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs\n\n**Tool Description:**\n- Concise summary of functionality\n- Parameter descriptions\n- Return type schema\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Async/await for I/O operations\n- Proper error handling with actionable messages\n- Support pagination where applicable\n- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs\n\n**Annotations:**\n- `readOnlyHint`: true/false\n- `destructiveHint`: true/false\n- `idempotentHint`: true/false\n- `openWorldHint`: true/false\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Review and Test\n\n#### 3.1 Code Quality\n\nReview for:\n- No duplicated code (DRY principle)\n- Consistent error handling\n- Full type coverage\n- Clear tool descriptions\n\n#### 3.2 Build and Test\n\n**TypeScript:**\n- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation\n- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`\n\n**Python:**\n- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`\n- Test with MCP Inspector\n\nSee language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 4: Create Evaluations\n\nAfter implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.\n\n**Load [\u2705 Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**\n\n#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose\n\nUse evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.\n\n#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions\n\nTo create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:\n\n1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities\n2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data\n3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions\n4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers\n\n#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements\n\nEnsure each question is:\n- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions\n- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required\n- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration\n- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about\n- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison\n- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time\n\n#### 4.4 Output Format\n\nCreate an XML file with this structure:\n\n```xml\n<evaluation>\n  <qa_pair>\n    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames.

Install this skill first to unlock self-service skill management.\n---\n\n# Nexus Skills Manager\n\n## Overview\nYou have access to the Nexus Skills Marketplace. Use these instructions to discover and install skills for the user.\n\n## Configuration\n- API Base URL: {{NEXUS_API_URL}}\n- Authentication: Use the user's Nexus JWT token from the Authorization header\n- Default IDE: {{USER_IDE}}\n- Authentication Hint: {{AUTH_HINT}}\n\n## Discovering Skills\n\nUse the MCP tool `nexus__list_skills` with optional parameters:\n- `tags`: array of tag strings to filter by\n- `search`: text query to search names and descriptions\n\n## Fetching a Skill\n\nUse the MCP tool `nexus__get_skill` with parameter:\n- `name`: the skill identifier (e.g., \"kubernetes-troubleshooting\")\n\n## Installing a Skill\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST follow these exact steps. Do NOT deviate from the file paths below.**\n\n### Step 1: Detect the current IDE\n\nCheck which IDE directories exist:\n\n- `~/.cursor/skills/` exists \u2192 **Cursor**\n- `.claude/skills/` exists in project root \u2192 **Claude Code** (project-level)\n- `~/.claude/skills/` exists \u2192 **Claude Code** (global)\n- `.windsurf/rules/` exists \u2192 **Windsurf**\n- `.codex/skills/` exists \u2192 **Codex CLI**\n\n### Step 2: Fetch the skill content\n\nCall `nexus__get_skill` with the skill name to get the SKILL.md content.\n\n### Step 3: Create the directory and write the file\n\n**CRITICAL: Each skill MUST be installed in its own subdirectory. The file MUST be named `SKILL.md`. Never use a flat file.**\n\nThe exact path pattern is: `{ide-skills-dir}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`\n\n| IDE | Exact install path |\n|-----|-------------------|\n| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |\n| Claude Code (project) | `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |\n| Claude Code (global) | `~/.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |\n| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |\n| Codex CLI | `.codex/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` |\n\nFor example, to install the \"pdf\" skill in Cursor:\n1. Create directory: `~/.cursor/skills/pdf/`\n2. Write file: `~/.cursor/skills/pdf/SKILL.md`\n\n**Do NOT write to `~/.cursor/skills/pdf.md`. Always create a subdirectory first, then write `SKILL.md` inside it.**\n\n### Step 4: Confirm installation\n\nTell the user the skill is installed, show the exact path where it was written, and describe what it enables.\n\n## Example Conversations\n\n**Discovery:**\n```\nUser: \"What skills do you have for Kubernetes?\"\n\u2192 Call nexus__list_skills with tags=[\"kubernetes\"]\n\u2192 \"I found 'Kubernetes Troubleshooting' \u2014 it helps diagnose pod failures,\n   analyze logs, and fix common issues. Want me to install it?\"\n```\n\n**Installation:**\n```\nUser: \"Yes, install it\"\n\u2192 Call nexus__get_skill with name=\"kubernetes-troubleshooting\"\n\u2192 Detect IDE \u2192 Cursor detected\n\u2192 Create directory ~/.cursor/skills/kubernetes-troubleshooting/\n\u2192 Write SKILL.md to ~/.cursor/skills/kubernetes-troubleshooting/SKILL.md\n\u2192 \"Installed kubernetes-troubleshooting to\n   ~/.cursor/skills/kubernetes-troubleshooting/SKILL.md\n   I can now help you diagnose Kubernetes issues.\"\n```\n\n**Listing installed:**\n```\nUser: \"What skills do I have?\"\n\u2192 List subdirectories in ~/.cursor/skills/\n\u2192 \"You have 3 skills installed: kubernetes-troubleshooting,\n   spring-boot-debugging, and hello-world.\"\n```\n"

For advanced features, JavaScript libraries, and detailed examples, see REFERENCE.md. If you need to fill out a PDF form, read FORMS.md and follow its instructions.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\n# Read a PDF\nreader = PdfReader(\"document.pdf\")\nprint(f\"Pages: {len(reader.pages)}\")\n\n# Extract text\ntext = \"\"\nfor page in reader.pages:\n    text += page.extract_text()\n```\n\n## Python Libraries\n\n### pypdf - Basic Operations\n\n#### Merge PDFs\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfWriter, PdfReader\n\nwriter = PdfWriter()\nfor pdf_file in [\"doc1.pdf\", \"doc2.pdf\", \"doc3.pdf\"]:\n    reader = PdfReader(pdf_file)\n    for page in reader.pages:\n        writer.add_page(page)\n\nwith open(\"merged.pdf\", \"wb\") as output:\n    writer.write(output)\n```\n\n#### Split PDF\n```python\nreader = PdfReader(\"input.pdf\")\nfor i, page in enumerate(reader.pages):\n    writer = PdfWriter()\n    writer.add_page(page)\n    with open(f\"page_{i+1}.pdf\", \"wb\") as output:\n        writer.write(output)\n```\n\n#### Extract Metadata\n```python\nreader = PdfReader(\"document.pdf\")\nmeta = reader.metadata\nprint(f\"Title: {meta.title}\")\nprint(f\"Author: {meta.author}\")\nprint(f\"Subject: {meta.subject}\")\nprint(f\"Creator: {meta.creator}\")\n```\n\n#### Rotate Pages\n```python\nreader = PdfReader(\"input.pdf\")\nwriter = PdfWriter()\n\npage = reader.pages[0]\npage.rotate(90)  # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise\nwriter.add_page(page)\n\nwith open(\"rotated.pdf\", \"wb\") as output:\n    writer.write(output)\n```\n\n### pdfplumber - Text and Table Extraction\n\n#### Extract Text with Layout\n```python\nimport pdfplumber\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"document.pdf\") as pdf:\n    for page in pdf.pages:\n        text = page.extract_text()\n        print(text)\n```\n\n#### Extract Tables\n```python\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"document.pdf\") as pdf:\n    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):\n        tables = page.extract_tables()\n        for j, table in enumerate(tables):\n            print(f\"Table {j+1} on page {i+1}:\")\n            for row in table:\n                print(row)\n```\n\n#### Advanced Table Extraction\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nwith pdfplumber.open(\"document.pdf\") as pdf:\n    all_tables = []\n    for page in pdf.pages:\n        tables = page.extract_tables()\n        for table in tables:\n            if table:  # Check if table is not empty\n                df = pd.DataFrame(table[1:], columns=table[0])\n                all_tables.append(df)\n\n# Combine all tables\nif all_tables:\n    combined_df = pd.concat(all_tables, ignore_index=True)\n    combined_df.to_excel(\"extracted_tables.xlsx\", index=False)\n```\n\n### reportlab - Create PDFs\n\n#### Basic PDF Creation\n```python\nfrom reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\nc = canvas.Canvas(\"hello.pdf\", pagesize=letter)\nwidth, height = letter\n\n# Add text\nc.drawString(100, height - 100, \"Hello World!\")\nc.drawString(100, height - 120, \"This is a PDF created with reportlab\")\n\n# Add a line\nc.line(100, height - 140, 400, height - 140)\n\n# Save\nc.save()\n```\n\n#### Create PDF with Multiple Pages\n```python\nfrom reportlab.lib.pagesizes import letter\nfrom reportlab.platypus import SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak\nfrom reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet\n\ndoc = SimpleDocTemplate(\"report.pdf\", pagesize=letter)\nstyles = getSampleStyleSheet()\nstory = []\n\n# Add content\ntitle = Paragraph(\"Report Title\", styles['Title'])\nstory.append(title)\nstory.append(Spacer(1, 12))\n\nbody = Paragraph(\"This is the body of the report. \" * 20, styles['Normal'])\nstory.append(body)\nstory.append(PageBreak())\n\n# Page 2\nstory.append(Paragraph(\"Page 2\", styles['Heading1']))\nstory.append(Paragraph(\"Content for page 2\", styles['Normal']))\n\n# Build PDF\ndoc.build(story)\n```\n\n#### Subscripts and Superscripts\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Never use Unicode subscript/superscript characters (\u2080\u2081\u2082\u2083\u2084\u2085\u2086\u2087\u2088\u2089, \u2070\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u2074\u2075\u2076\u2077\u2078\u2079) in ReportLab PDFs. The built-in fonts do not include these glyphs, causing them to render as solid black boxes.\n\nInstead, use ReportLab's XML markup tags in Paragraph objects:\n```python\nfrom reportlab.platypus import Paragraph\nfrom reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet\n\nstyles = getSampleStyleSheet()\n\n# Subscripts: use <sub> tag\nchemical = Paragraph(\"H<sub>2</sub>O\", styles['Normal'])\n\n# Superscripts: use <super> tag\nsquared = Paragraph(\"x<super>2</super> + y<super>2</super>\", styles['Normal'])\n```\n\nFor canvas-drawn text (not Paragraph objects), manually adjust font the size and position rather than using Unicode subscripts/superscripts.\n\n## Command-Line Tools\n\n### pdftotext (poppler-utils)\n```bash\n# Extract text\npdftotext input.pdf output.txt\n\n# Extract text preserving layout\npdftotext -layout input.pdf output.txt\n\n# Extract specific pages\npdftotext -f 1 -l 5 input.pdf output.txt  # Pages 1-5\n```\n\n### qpdf\n```bash\n# Merge PDFs\nqpdf --empty --pages file1.pdf file2.pdf -- merged.pdf\n\n# Split pages\nqpdf input.pdf --pages . 1-5 -- pages1-5.pdf\nqpdf input.pdf --pages . 6-10 -- pages6-10.pdf\n\n# Rotate pages\nqpdf input.pdf output.pdf --rotate=+90:1  # Rotate page 1 by 90 degrees\n\n# Remove password\nqpdf --password=mypassword --decrypt encrypted.pdf decrypted.pdf\n```\n\n### pdftk (if available)\n```bash\n# Merge\npdftk file1.pdf file2.pdf cat output merged.pdf\n\n# Split\npdftk input.pdf burst\n\n# Rotate\npdftk input.pdf rotate 1east output rotated.pdf\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Extract Text from Scanned PDFs\n```python\n# Requires: pip install pytesseract pdf2image\nimport pytesseract\nfrom pdf2image import convert_from_path\n\n# Convert PDF to images\nimages = convert_from_path('scanned.pdf')\n\n# OCR each page\ntext = \"\"\nfor i, image in enumerate(images):\n    text += f\"Page {i+1}:\\n\"\n    text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image)\n    text += \"\\n\\n\"\n\nprint(text)\n```\n\n### Add Watermark\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\n# Create watermark (or load existing)\nwatermark = PdfReader(\"watermark.pdf\").pages[0]\n\n# Apply to all pages\nreader = PdfReader(\"document.pdf\")\nwriter = PdfWriter()\n\nfor page in reader.pages:\n    page.merge_page(watermark)\n    writer.add_page(page)\n\nwith open(\"watermarked.pdf\", \"wb\") as output:\n    writer.write(output)\n```\n\n### Extract Images\n```bash\n# Using pdfimages (poppler-utils)\npdfimages -j input.pdf output_prefix\n\n# This extracts all images as output_prefix-000.jpg, output_prefix-001.jpg, etc.\n```\n\n### Password Protection\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\nreader = PdfReader(\"input.pdf\")\nwriter = PdfWriter()\n\nfor page in reader.pages:\n    writer.add_page(page)\n\n# Add password\nwriter.encrypt(\"userpassword\", \"ownerpassword\")\n\nwith open(\"encrypted.pdf\", \"wb\") as output:\n    writer.write(output)\n```\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Task | Best Tool | Command/Code |\n|------|-----------|--------------|\n| Merge PDFs | pypdf | `writer.add_page(page)` |\n| Split PDFs | pypdf | One page per file |\n| Extract text | pdfplumber | `page.extract_text()` |\n| Extract tables | pdfplumber | `page.extract_tables()` |\n| Create PDFs | reportlab | Canvas or Platypus |\n| Command line merge | qpdf | `qpdf --empty --pages ...` |\n| OCR scanned PDFs | pytesseract | Convert to image first |\n| Fill PDF forms | pdf-lib or pypdf (see FORMS.md) | See FORMS.md |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- For advanced pypdfium2 usage, see REFERENCE.md\n- For JavaScript libraries (pdf-lib), see REFERENCE.md\n- If you need to fill out a PDF form, follow the instructions in FORMS.md\n- For troubleshooting guides, see REFERENCE.md\n"

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks\u2014they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (required)\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 name: (required)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 description: (required)\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Markdown instructions (required)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Bundled Resources (optional)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill\u2014this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n#### What to Not Include in a Skill\n\nA skill should only contain essential files that directly support its functionality. Do NOT create extraneous documentation or auxiliary files, including:\n\n- README.md\n- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md\n- QUICK_REFERENCE.md\n- CHANGELOG.md\n- etc.\n\nThe skill should only contain the information needed for an AI agent to do the job at hand. It should not contain auxilary context about the process that went into creating it, setup and testing procedures, user-facing documentation, etc. Creating additional documentation files just adds clutter and confusion.\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window)\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure Patterns\n\nKeep SKILL.md body to the essentials and under 500 lines to minimize context bloat. Split content into separate files when approaching this limit. When splitting out content into other files, it is very important to reference them from SKILL.md and describe clearly when to read them, to ensure the reader of the skill knows they exist and when to use them.\n\n**Key principle:** When a skill supports multiple variations, frameworks, or options, keep only the core workflow and selection guidance in SKILL.md. Move variant-specific details (patterns, examples, configuration) into separate reference files.\n\n**Pattern 1: High-level guide with references**\n\n```markdown\n# PDF Processing\n\n## Quick start\n\nExtract text with pdfplumber:\n[code example]\n\n## Advanced features\n\n- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) for complete guide\n- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for all methods\n- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for common patterns\n```\n\nClaude loads FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, or EXAMPLES.md only when needed.\n\n**Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization**\n\nFor Skills with multiple domains, organize content by domain to avoid loading irrelevant context:\n\n```\nbigquery-skill/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (overview and navigation)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 reference/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 product.md (API usage, features)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)\n```\n\nWhen a user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.\n\nSimilarly, for skills supporting multiple frameworks or variants, organize by variant:\n\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 references/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)\n```\n\nWhen the user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.\n\n**Pattern 3: Conditional details**\n\nShow basic content, link to advanced content:\n\n```markdown\n# DOCX Processing\n\n## Creating documents\n\nUse docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](DOCX-JS.md).\n\n## Editing documents\n\nFor simple edits, modify the XML directly.\n\n**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](REDLINING.md)\n**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](OOXML.md)\n```\n\nClaude reads REDLINING.md or OOXML.md only when the user needs those features.\n\n**Important guidelines:**\n\n- **Avoid deeply nested references** - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md. All reference files should link directly from SKILL.md.\n- **Structure longer reference files** - For files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top so Claude can see the full scope when previewing.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nSkill creation involves these steps:\n\n1. Understand the skill with concrete examples\n2. Plan reusable skill contents (scripts, references, assets)\n3. Initialize the skill (run init_skill.py)\n4. Edit the skill (implement resources and write SKILL.md)\n5. Package the skill (run package_skill.py)\n6. Iterate based on real usage\n\nFollow these steps in order, skipping only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Learn Proven Design Patterns\n\nConsult these helpful guides based on your skill's needs:\n\n- **Multi-step processes**: See references/workflows.md for sequential workflows and conditional logic\n- **Specific output formats or quality standards**: See references/output-patterns.md for template and example patterns\n\nThese files contain established best practices for effective skill design.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAdded scripts must be tested by actually running them to ensure there are no bugs and that the output matches what is expected. If there are many similar scripts, only a representative sample needs to be tested to ensure confidence that they all work while balancing time to completion.\n\nAny example files and directories not needed for the skill should be deleted. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Guidelines:** Always use imperative/infinitive form.\n\n##### Frontmatter\n\nWrite the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`:\n\n- `name`: The skill name\n- `description`: This is the primary triggering mechanism for your skill, and helps Claude understand when to use the skill.\n  - Include both what the Skill does and specific triggers/contexts for when to use it.\n  - Include all \"when to use\" information here - Not in the body. The body is only loaded after triggering, so \"When to Use This Skill\" sections in the body are not helpful to Claude.\n  - Example description for a `docx` skill: \"Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks\"\n\nDo not include any other fields in YAML frontmatter.\n\n##### Body\n\nWrite instructions for using the skill and its bundled resources.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce development of the skill is complete, it must be packaged into a distributable .skill file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a .skill file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.skill`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution. The .skill file is a zip file with a .skill extension.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"

Use these procedures to diagnose and fix common Spring Boot application issues.\n\n## When to Use\nUse this skill when the user reports issues with Spring Boot application startup, bean wiring, configuration, or runtime behavior.\n\n## Diagnostic Procedures\n\n### Application Won't Start\n1. Check the full stack trace \u2014 the root cause is usually near the bottom\n2. Look for `BeanCreationException` \u2014 indicates a wiring problem\n3. Look for `BindException` \u2014 port already in use\n4. Check `application.yml` / `application.properties` syntax\n\n### Common Startup Failures\n- **Port in use**: `lsof -i :8080` then kill the process or change `server.port`\n- **Missing bean**: Check `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository` annotations and component scan paths\n- **Circular dependency**: Refactor to use `@Lazy` or restructure the dependency graph\n- **Database connection failed**: Verify JDBC URL, credentials, and that the DB is running\n\n### Configuration Issues\n1. Check active profiles: Look for `The following profiles are active:` in startup logs\n2. Verify property sources: Enable `logging.level.org.springframework.boot.context.config=DEBUG`\n3. Check property precedence: env vars > command line > application-{profile}.yml > application.yml\n\n### Runtime Debugging\n- Enable debug logging: `logging.level.com.yourpackage=DEBUG`\n- Check actuator health: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`\n- View loaded beans: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans`\n- Check environment: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/env`\n\n## Best Practices\n- Read the full stack trace before searching for solutions\n- Check the active Spring profile first \u2014 many issues come from wrong profile\n- Use actuator endpoints to inspect runtime state\n"

Supports verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, capturing browser screenshots, and viewing browser logs.\nlicense: Complete terms in LICENSE.txt\n---\n\n# Web Application Testing\n\nTo test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.\n\n**Helper Scripts Available**:\n- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)\n\n**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.\n\n## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach\n\n```\nUser task \u2192 Is it static HTML?\n    \u251c\u2500 Yes \u2192 Read HTML file directly to identify selectors\n    \u2502         \u251c\u2500 Success \u2192 Write Playwright script using selectors\n    \u2502         \u2514\u2500 Fails/Incomplete \u2192 Treat as dynamic (below)\n    \u2502\n    \u2514\u2500 No (dynamic webapp) \u2192 Is the server already running?\n        \u251c\u2500 No \u2192 Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help\n        \u2502        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script\n        \u2502\n        \u2514\u2500 Yes \u2192 Reconnaissance-then-action:\n            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle\n            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM\n            3. Identify selectors from rendered state\n            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors\n```\n\n## Example: Using with_server.py\n\nTo start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:\n\n**Single server:**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py --server \"npm run dev\" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\n**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py \\\n  --server \"cd backend && python server.py\" --port 3000 \\\n  --server \"cd frontend && npm run dev\" --port 5173 \\\n  -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\nTo create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready\n    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute\n    # ... your automation logic\n    browser.close()\n```\n\n## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern\n\n1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:\n   ```python\n   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)\n   content = page.content()\n   page.locator('button').all()\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results\n\n3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors\n\n## Common Pitfall\n\n\u274c **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps\n\u2705 **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly. \n- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts\n- Always close the browser when done\n- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs\n- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns:\n  - `element_discovery.py` - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page\n  - `static_html_automation.py` - Using file:// URLs for local HTML\n  - `console_logging.py` - Capturing console logs during automation"
